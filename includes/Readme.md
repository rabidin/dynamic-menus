This is a WordPress plugin. It adds dynamic menu items to WordPress Menus Programmatically. Menu items are visible/not visible based on the following parameters (updatable by the administrator):
	*	start and end time.
	*	is_logged_in and isnot_logged_in (can be based on certain user_login).
	*	is_front_page and isnot_front_page.
	*	is_home and isnot_home.
	*	Url/POST parameter exists (can be based on a certain value).
